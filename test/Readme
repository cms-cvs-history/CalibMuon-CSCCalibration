############ THIS IS A LIST OF CALIBRATION CODE FOR CSC CATHODE STRIPS and ANODE WIRES ############

0. Set up an area for CMSSW and get CalibMuon/CSCCalibration (see below older instructions).
0.1 cc files are in /src and .h files in /interface. Configuration files and BuildFile in /test

Copy .so files for ORACLE database transfer from:
      
       http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/CSC/CERN/dbc_library/   (copy: libcondbc.so)
       http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/CSC/CERN/cscmap_library/    (copy: libcscmap.so)

    to your /CMSSW_x_x_x/lib/slc3_ia32_gcc323/ area.


1. CSCGainAnalyzer.cc and .h run with cmsRun and configuration file CSCgain.cfg 

1.1 condbc.h changed to accept floats (old one for doubles is called condbc_double.h) 

2. CSCCrossTalkAnalyzer.cc and .h run with cmsRun and configuration file CSCxtalk.cfg

3. CSCAFEBdacAnalyzer.cc and .h run with cmsRun and configuration file CSCAFEBdac.cfg

4. CSCCompThreshAnalyzer.cc and .h run with cmsRun and configuration file CSCcomp.cfg

5. There is a new library and .h file for transfer to DB that uses objects for the transfer. This will be 
   (in the future) the way to transfer constants to DB!!

This is the status 2006.05.16 !!!!!

RunNum1083Evs0to9999.bin for gains (ME1 chambers)

	

*****************************************************************************************************
This is an older way to run, all files have been removed, but they exist in /Attic in CVS! 
You need to get your own condbc.h file for double if you want double precission 
and change in the code float to double for the DB transfer!!
 
Usage of programs listed here:

0.1 Create your project area CMSSW_x_x_x by:
     scramv1 project CMSSW CMSSW_x_x_x
     cd CMSSW_x_x_x/src
     check out from CVS (cvs co ) the following packages:
      
      CondFormats/CSCObjects
      DataFormats/CSCDigi
      Geometry/CSCSimAlgo
      IORawData/CSCCommissioning
      CalibMuon/CSCCalibration   ( ***<- work in directory /test in this package ->*** )
	
0.1 execute !ev ( which means setenv `scramv1 runtime -csh` == set up necessary CMSSW environment ).

0.2 Copy .so files for ORACLE database transfer from:
      
       http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/CSC/CERN/dbc_library/   (copy: libcondbc.so)
       http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/CSC/CERN/cscmap_library/    (copy: libcscmap.so)

    to your /CMSSW_x_x_x/lib/slc3_ia32_gcc323/ area.

0.3 Build all packages by executing "scramv1 b" in directories where a BuildFile is present or at the very top 
(in CMSSW_x_x_x/src).


1.  Make soft links to all of the executables so you can run from test, alternatively run them from 
    CMSSW_x_x_x/CMSSW_x_x_x/test/slc3_ia32_gcc323/  where executables will be created.

1.0 Suggestion: create a directory called runs where you have the data.

1.1 Suggestion: create a directory called ntuples where all root files will be put.

2.  Run executables in /test or CMSSW_x_x_x/CMSSW_x_x_x/test/slc3_ia32_gcc323/ directory using:
        
	    ./executable_name data_file.bin

3.  Calibration data files are usually in emuslice02:/data/test_results/   - look for recent .bin files (!)
    OR CASTOR. To get them from CASTOR (usually works from an lxplus account) : 
       
	     rfcp /castor/cern.ch/cms/emuslice/2005/filename .  

4.  Output of executables:  

         ROOT ntuples and arrays containing calibration constants which can be moved to online database.

5.  Any changes in the *.cpp files -> have to recompile again! (scramv1 b)

6.  At present you have to uncomment the lines: cdb->cdb_write(....) to be able o transfer the constants to DB.

a.  Pedestal values in 5 ME2 chambers:	
	from inside root type:

b. Gains in 5 ME2 chambers:
	from inside root type:
