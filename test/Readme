############ THIS IS A LIST OF CALIBRATION CODE FOR CSC CATHODE STRIPS and ANODE WIRES ############

OBS!!!  This is not yet according to CMSSW rules, but need to keep a copy for myself and whomever wants to look at this code !!!!

Usage of programs listed here:

0.1 Create your project area CMSSW_x_x_x and check out the following packages:
      
      CondFormats/CSCObjects
      DataFormats/CSCDigi
      Geometry/CSCSimAlgo
      IORawData/CSCCommissioning
      CalibMuon/CSCCalibration   ( <- work in directory /test in this package -> )
	
0.1 execute !ev ( which means setenv `scramv1 runtime -csh` == set up necessary CMSSW environment ).

0.2 Build all packages by executing "scramv1 b" in directories where a BuildFile is present or at the very top ( in src).

0.3 Copy .so files for ORACLE database transfer from:
      
       http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/cms/CSC/CERN/dbc_library/   (copy: libcondbc.so)
       http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/CSC/CERN/cscmap_library/    (copy: libcscmap.so)

    to your /CMSSW_x_x_x/lib/slc3_ia32_gcc323/ area.

1.  Execute "scramv1 b" to create executables for all files in working directory.

2.  Make soft links to all of the executables so you can run from test, alternatively run them from 
    CMSSW_x_x_x/CMSSW_x_x_x/test/slc3_ia32_gcc323/  where executables will be put.

3.  Run executables in /test directory using:
        
	    ./executable_name data_file.bin

4.  Calibration data files are usually in emuslice02:/data/test_results/   - look for recent .bin files (!)
    OR CASTOR. To get them from CASTOR (usually works from an lxplus account) : 
       
	     rfcp /castor/cern.ch/cms/emuslice/2005/filename .  

5.  Output of executables:  

         ROOT ntuples and arrays containing calibration constants which can be moved to online database.

6.  Any changes in the *.cpp files -> have to recompile again! (scramv1 b)

  


    This is the status on 2006.02.23 !!!!! MANY changes to come!
