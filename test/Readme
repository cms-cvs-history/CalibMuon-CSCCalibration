OBS!!!  This is not yet according to CMSSW rules, but need to keep a copy for myyself or whomever wants to look at this code !!!!

Usage of programs listed here:

0.1 Create your project area CMSSW_x_x_x and check out the following packages:
      
      CondFormats/CSCObjects
      DataFormats/CSCDigi
      Geometry/CSCSimAlgo
      IORawData/CSCCommissioning
	
0.1 execute !ev ( which means setenv `scramv1 runtime -csh`  )

0.2 Build all of them by executing scramv1 b in directories where a BuildFile is present or at the top

1.  Copy the *.cpp files to EventFilter/CSCRawToDigi/test

2.  Execute  scramv1 b to create executables for all of them 

3.  Make soft links to all of the executables so you can run from test, alternatively run them from 
    CMSSW_x_x_x/CMSSW_x_x_x/test/slc3_ia32_gcc323/  where they will be created

4.  Execution:
        
	    ./executable_name data_file.bin

5.  Calibration data files are usually in emuslice02:/data/test_results/ 
    OR CASTOR. To get them from CASTOR (usually works from an lxplus account) : 
       
	     rfcp /castor/cern.ch/cms/emuslice/2005/filename .  

6.  Output of executables:  ROOT ntuples and arrays containing calibration constants which can be moved to online database.

7.  Any changes in the *.cpp files -> have to recompile again! (scramv1 b)

8.  This is the status on 2006.02.23 !!!!! MANY changes to come!
